* About
tile provides a way to interactively cycle through pre-defined custom layout
definitions Ã  la XMonad. Inspiration was taken from [[https://github.com/lgfang/elisp/blob/master/tiling.el][here]], but this is pretty
much a complete rewrite. This package differs from others like workgroups2,
perspective and eyebrowse in that it is only concerned with window
configurations, and not necessarily what is contained in each window.
* Author's Configuration
The author's configuration can be found [[http://ivanmalison.github.io/dotfiles/#tile][here]]. Check it out for some ideas about how to customize tile.
